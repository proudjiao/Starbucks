# How close are two starbucks stores?

The project involves using Python to scrape Starbucks locations from their website based on zip codes in LA County. The script calculates the distances between Starbucks locations using geodesic distance and creates a map of LA County with markers for each Starbucks location. The map also shows the shortest distance between each location and its closest Starbucks. Finally, the script generates a histogram showing the distribution of distances to the closest Starbucks and marks the mean distance on the plot.
